-What's new in PHP
=====================================
-We currently use 5.3 for pretty much all of our clients
-PHP is old, but 82% of sites still run it
-42.8% are still using 5.3, we fall into this bracket
-8.2% are using 5.5, we want to be here!
-http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php/5/all
-Does some housekeeping
--E_ALL finally includes E_STRICT
--No longer guesses timezone
--No longer magically gets superglobal
-Finally does its bit to increase security with easy password hashing and salting, no more md5 !
-Traits - Building blocks for a class
--Share common functionality beween classes that do no change
--All objects extend varien_object, that would be a prime candidate for using a trait as they dont reaaaaaaaaaly extend and arent logically grouped together
--Used for logger.
-Generators
--CoRoutines
-APC (Alternative PHP cache) is not available, whaaaaaaaaaaa OPCache is included in 5.5. Be chill. (Although it is disabled by default, it's just an ini setting)

-hhvm at etsy
=====================================
-http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/03/etsy-deploy-50-times-a-day
-Hip Hop PHP
-Compile PHP to C++, deploy the binary, separate dev env, hassle!
-HHVM doesnt compile the php, its just a VM that replaced "php" as the thing you install
-3 of the big 10 php websites use HHVM
-Mixed results, extensions havent been ported over, high pass rate.
-http://hhvm.com/blog/7205/wikipedia-on-hhvm
-For etsy to get it running on just their API server they had to upgrade, gcc, libmecached, libmcrypt, more, and more.
-hhvm is "rock solid" but extensions sometimes have some bugs.
